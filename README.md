Zoom has a pretty gnarly client, and it is unclear if it can be trusted.
Why trust a new application, Zoom client, when Zoom has a perfectly good web client that requires no more than trusting the web browser you probably already trust.

This extension redirects all zoom join links opened in chrome to the web client which you can use instead of having it prompt you to install the desktop client, or if you have it installed, prompt you to launch it.
This extension being forced onto end users essentially hides the fact that there even is a "preferred" desktop client, and instead just drops them straight into the web client from join links. This way you don't have to worry about what the desktop client is doing, and rest assured that the zoom client end users are using isn't vulnerable to any RCE exploits and has a lot more limited ability to collect analytic data and act as spyware, as it is just running in the browser.
